# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree

This folder contains my work done for the 
[Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

**This course contains 3 sections and 1 accompanying project per section:**

1. Intro to Computer Vision, which covers basic computer vision topics like image processing, 
feature extraction (Canny edge detection, ORB descriptor, HoG, etc...) done manually 
or through training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch. 
**The project** here was to train a CNN to detect facial key-points.
2. Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning, which was focused into deep learning topics. 
Main focus was on object detection (Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO) and 
image segmentation (fully convolutional networks) and RNNs in combination with attention models. 
**The project** was image captioning implemented with a deep learning model which combined CNN with RNN.
3. Object Tracking and Localization, which covers how a robot can move and sense the world around it.
**The project** was implementation of graph-based SLAM of a simple robot in a 2D world.
