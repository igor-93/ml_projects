# Machine Learning Projects

Repository contains ML-related code: 
1. ML util functions:
    1. `common/`
    2. `clustering/`
    3. `analysis/`
    4. `preprocessing/`
    5. `timeseries/`
2. Recent ML projects:

    2. `cv_course_udacity/`: code for projects on Computer Vision Nanodegree on Udacity 
    3. `airbus_ship_detection/`: project from Kaggle
For more details see README files in each of the folders for more details.

More of my ML projects are in separate repos:
1. [ETH Data mining course projects](https://github.com/igor-93/dm2017)
2. [ETH Machine learning course projects](https://github.com/igor-93/ml2016)
3. [ETH CIL Road segmentation project](https://github.com/FelipeSulser/Computational-Intelligence-Lab---ETHZ)
4. [ETH Computer vision course exercises](https://github.com/igor-93/cv2017)

### Tests
From the this directory run `python -m unittest discover`

TODO: add tests for KMedoids
