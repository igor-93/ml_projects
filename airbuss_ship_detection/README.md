# Airbus ship detection 

[Kaggle Project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/overview/description)

tasks:
1. implement submission encoding
1. implement metric calcuation
1. data augmentation: 
    - since it is highly unbalanced dataset, we will need to augment data with positive class
    - e.g. by rotating ships, zooming-in and -out the ships in the images...
1. implement the benchamrk model 
    - be careful that the data is too big for the RAM
